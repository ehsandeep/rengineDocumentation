This document aims to provide detailed instructions on setting up and running the reNgine . For detailed instruction on \"How to use reNgine\" after setup, it has been provided in Usage Section . This document is divided into 2 parts: It is highly recommended that you follow each steps to avoid encountering any errors/issues during the setup. Prerequisites reNgine Installation Prerequisites reNgine uses several scripts and tools, they rely on different other tools to be installed like Go, python, etc and to avoid any dependency issues, we decided to use Docker. Using Docker will not only ease the dependency issues, but will also ease the installation steps. As a penetration tester, you need not focus much on solving the dependencies, installing required tools, etc. With few installation steps, you should be good to run reNgine . reNgine requires these tools to be installed before you begin any installation steps: Docker Docker provides very good documentation on how to install docker based on your Operating System. You can follow the documentation here. Docker installation on Ubuntu/Linux Distributions Warning The installation steps have been directly taken from Docker Guide with no modification. Update the apt package index and install the below packages sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install \\ apt-transport-https \\ ca-certificates \\ curl \\ gnupg-agent \\ software-properties-common Add Docker official GPG key curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - Use the following commands to setup the stable repository sudo add-apt-repository \\ \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(lsb_release -cs) \\ stable\" Finally install Docker Engine sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io Test the Docker by running docker command on your console/terminal. Docker installation on Windows Docker requires Docker Desktop to be installed on your Windows OS. Installing Docker Desktop is as easy as double clicking the InstallDocker.msi installer, downloaded from here . Docker installation on Mac OS Docker requires Docker Desktop to be installed on your Mac OS. Follow the instruction from Docker hub to install Docker on Mac OS . Docker installation on Windows WSL Nick Janetakis has a well written blog and a Video guide on how to install Docker on Windows Subsystem Linux . Please follow the video/blog guide on how to install Docker on WSL. Docker Compose If you're running Docker Desktop you can skip installing docker-compose as docker-compose comes along with Docker Desktop. This applies for both Windows and Mac OS users. If you're using Linux distributions or WSL, you will still need to install docker-compose and the installation steps are similar. Installing docker-compose on Linux systems Download the latest stable version of docker-compose sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Apply executable permission sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Create a symbolic link sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose Verify your installation by running docker-compose --version Info If curl is not working for some reason, there are alternate installation steps as well. You can use pip or install as a container. Follow the alternate installation steps . make make installation on Linux Distributions Install the latest version of make using sudo apt install make Although it is optional, build-essential package can also be installed which contains make utility. sudo apt install build-essential reNgine Installation Installing reNgine on your favourite VPS or on your local machine is pretty straight forward process. Installation instruction for VPS and local machine is similar and same steps can be followed. If you have met all the above Prerequisites , you can begin installing reNgine . Let's begin by cloning the reNgine . git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine cd rengine There are currently two different ways of installing reNgine . Using make Manually using docker-compose Using make is by far the easiest way to setup reNgine without encountering any errors. Using docker-compose is a tidious process and is only intended for development purpose. Unless otherwise you're developing reNgine , it is recommended that you use make to install reNgine . Installation steps using docker-compose can be found in Developer's section. dotenv file Before we begin installing reNgine, it is necessary to make changes to the dotenv file. You can edit the file using your favourite editor nano .env or vim .env The sample .env file can be found here . # # General # COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=rengine # # SSL specific configuration # AUTHORITY_NAME=reNgine AUTHORITY_PASSWORD=mySecurePassword COMPANY=reNgine DOMAIN_NAME=recon.example.com COUNTRY_CODE=IN STATE=Karnataka CITY=Bangalore Generating SSL Certificates reNgine runs on https unless otherwise used for development purpose. So using https is recommended. To generate the certificates you can use make certs Please note, while running any make command, you must be inside the rengine/ directory. Build reNgine To build the reNgine, use the following command make build The build process is a lengthy process and may take some time. Thanks to Baptiste MOINE for sending the PR that made build process so much simpler. Run reNgine Once the build process is successful, we're good to run reNgine. This can be done using below command make up reNgine can now be accessed from https://127.0.0.1 or if you're on the VPS https://your_vps_ip_address Registering an account The recent upgrade bring authentication feature on reNgine. You will need to create a username and password in order to login to the reNgine. To register reNgine, you will need to run the following command make username You will now be prompted with some personal details(optional), username and password. We highly recommend that you set a strong password for reNgine. You may now login to the reNgine web portal using the username and password that you just provided. Checking logs If you need to observe the logs, it can be done so by running the commmand make logs Note If you encounter any issues while setup or scan, we advice you to raise an issue in Github and attach the log. While raising any new issues on Github, it is also adviced that you to look for any open issues on Github as well. Stopping the reNgine If you wish to stop the reNgine, it can be done so by using the command make stop Restarting the reNgine reNgine can be restarted using the command make restart Removing all the reNgine Data If you wish to delete all your recon data, it can be done using Danger This is a irreversible process and once pruned, you may never get back your recon data.

If you are looking for installation instructions and want to ensure if you have met the prerequisites, we suggest you to look at the installation instructions and prerequisites sections. Targets Target could be a domain or a subdomain, that you can run the scan against. Having a target is a must and a basic requirement to run any scan. Support for IP address as a target is coming soon. Adding Targets To add the Target , navigate to the left sidebar menu and click on Add Target submenu. Using this option, you can add one target at a time, for importing multiple targets, follow the Importing Targets guide. Importing Targets reNgine provides the ability to import multiple targets. To import multiple targets, click on the Import Targets options from Targets menu. File extension support reNgine currently supports importing targets only from .txt and .csv files. Importing Targets from txt file Please note that the txt file must only contain domain names or subdomain names. Any other format will be rejected by rengine. Supported txt Format hackerone.com docs.hackerone.com nepal.gov.np UnSupported txt Format https://hackerone.com https://docs.hackerone.com nepal.gov.np/docs Importing Targets from csv file reNgine also provides an option to import targets from a csv file.

Supported CSV Format hackerone.com docs.hackerone.com, Hackerone Docs nepal.gov.np, Nepal Government Bug Bounty UnSupported CSV Format https://hackerone.com, Hackerone, Target https://docs.hackerone.com Configurations Tools like amass and subfinder uses configuration files to unleash the power of these tools. These configuration files often contains API keys, and other configurations used to gather more accurate results. reNgine provides the ability to upload your configuration files for various tools and use them in the scan engines. Adding new Configurations To add the Configurations , select the Configurations menu from left sidebar and click on Add new Configuration . Fields Configuration Name : The configuration name for you to identify. Short Name : The short name is automatically generated, though you have an option to change it. The short name is an identifier to the config file, that will be used to reference in the Scan Engine YAML Configuration . Actual Configuration : Paste your actual configuration. TIP: Sample Configurations If you have difficulty setting up the config file, you can find the sample config files below. Subfinder Configuration Amass Configuration Using the config file in Scan Engine will be discussed in the Setting up Scan Engine section. Wordlist Tools like dirsearch or amass uses wordlist to bruteforce the directories or subdomains. reNgine provides the ability to upload your own wordlists. Adding new Wordlist To upload your Wordlists , selection the Wordlists menu from left sidebar and click on Add new Wordlist . Fields Wordlist Name : The Wordlist name for you to identify. Short Name : The short name is automatically generated, though you have an option to change it. The short name is an identifier to the config file, that will be used to reference in the Scan Engine YAML Configuration . Upload your wordlist in txt file format. Using the wordlist in Scan Engine will be discussed in the Setting up Scan Engine section. Common Wordlists Some of the common wordlists for your scans. * Seclists * Jason Haddix DNS Enumeration wordlist * Jason Haddix Content Discovery wordlist Default Wordlist reNgine also has default wordlist called deepmagic top 5000 prefix, which can be referenced in scan engines using wordlist: default Scan Engines One of the core components of reNgine is Scan Engine. Scan Engines lets you define the type of scan you wish to perform along with the ability to choose the tools, and dive deep into the configurations using the YAML configuration. You can define as many scan engines as you want, with the type of configurations you wish. Scan Engines are capable of performing: reNgine Scan Engine capabilities Subdomain Discovery : Discovers all the subdomains using tools like sublist3r, subfinder, amass, assetfinder, etc. Port Scan : Use to identify the open ports on the subdomains that have been discovered. Currently reNgine uses naabu to check for open ports. We have plans to use masscan in the future. Directory and File Search : Uses dirsearch to discover the directories and files. Fetch all Endpoints : Fetches all the urls for each subdomains from various sources like Open Threat Exchange, Wayback machine, common crawl etc. reNgine uses gau , hakrawler to fetch the endpoints. Vulnerability Scan (Beta) : reNgine uses nuclei to perform the Vulnerability Scans on the targets. Default Engines in reNgine Default Scan Engines reNgine comes with 3 preinstalled Scan Engines, namely Full Scan , Passive Scan and Subdomain only scan Full Scan This scan engine will perform all the capabilities of reNgine, namely Subdomain Discovery, Port Scan, Directory and File search, Fetch all endpoints, Vulnerability Scan. Running a Full Scan will take more time compared to other scans. Passive Scan This scan engine will perform only the passive scan , namely Subdomain Discovery, and will Fetch all endpoints. Active scanning like Port Scan, Directory and File Search is disabled. Also, no vulnerability scan will be performed. Subdomain only scan This scan engine will perform only the Subdomain Scan, all other capabilities are disabled. Defining new Scan Engines To define a new Scan Engine in reNgine, click on Scan Engine menu from left sidebar and the click on Add New Engine button. Add new Scan Engine Fields Engine Name : Name of the Engine Choose the type of scan you want this engine to perform. YAML Configuration : YAML configuration for the scan engine. YAML configuration will help you choose the tools required to gather information and also focus on other configurations like defining number of threads, configurations, wordlists, etc. YAML Setting for Scan Engine will be explained separately on Guide to defining YAML configuration for scan engines section. Notification reNgine currently supports Slack Hooks for sending notification to update you about the scan status. If notifications are enabled, this will send you notification for any found vulnerabilities, and scan status. Currently the notification service works only with slack. In future, we might bring support for collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, Telegram and others, as of now we do not have any immediate plans to integrate with other collaboration platform. If you want to learn more on how to get the slack web hook URL, please follow this guide . Adding Notification Hook You can add the notification hook from Notification menu, and click on Add new Hook . Follow the instructions from Slack Web Hook Documentation and get the web hook for your slack channel. Enter the web hook URL in Hook URL field and give a name to your slack channel. Click on submit menu. You will now receive notifications on slack channel for any scan update and if any vulnerability has been found. Disabling/Enabling Notifications You can disable the notifications, if you no longer need them. This can be done after clicking on Notification menu from left side bar and enable/disable the notification from Send Notification column. Initiating Scan Initiating the scan in reNgine is pretty simple and straight forward process. If you've already defined the Targets and Scan Engines : Click on List Targets sub menu under Targets menu. You will see all the targets that you've added or imported. To initiate the quick scan click on the Quick Scan option from Actions column. Click on the Quick Scan icon. Choose the Scan Engine Then click on Start Scan button. To view the results, you can navigate to Scan History menu. Scan Status reNgine has 4 different scan status. Scan Status Scanning : The target is being currently scanned. Pending : The target is currently on pending mode. reNgine can scan 4 targets in parallel, when there are more than 4 targets being scanned at a time, the 5th target goes into pending mode. Once the scan is completed, the 5th scan automatically goes into Scanning mode. Aborted : The scan has been force stopped by the user. Failed : The scan has been failed. Please Check the Logs as to why the scan has failed. Scheduling Scan With the recent upgrade, reNgine can schedule the scan in the future as well, also scan be periodically scheduled as well. The two types of scans have been described below. If you've already defined the Targets and Scan Engines , you can easily schedule the scan: Click on List Targets sub menu under Targets menu. You will see all the targets that you've added or imported. To initiate the quick scan click on the Schedule Scan option from Actions column. Click on the Schedule Scan icon. Choose the Scheduler type and engine as well. (Scheduler types has been described in detail below.) Then click on Schedule Scan button. To view the results, you can navigate to Scan History menu. Types of Scheduler There are currently two types of schedulers in reNgine Periodic Scan Clocked Scan Periodic Scan reNgine provides the ability to periodically schedule the scan like, \"I want to scan example.com every 10 minutes\" or \"I want to schedule the scan every 10 days\". Periodic scan will allow you to schedule the scan every X Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Clocked Scan Clocked scan are different than Periodic Scan. In clocked scan, you can schedule the scan at a specific time. Like, \"I want to schedule the scan at 3 pm August 2021.\" In clocked scan, running the clocked scan repeatedly is not currently supported. This will be released in the future. For now, Clocked Scan are one time task. Vulnerability Scan (Beta) v0.4 and above, reNgine supports Nuclei for vulnerability scan. While defining Scan Engines , select Vulnerability Scanner. Other Nuclei related configuration will be discussed in defining the YAML configutation for Scan Engines section. There's a lot to improve for Vulnerability Scan in reNgine. Currently there is no way to supply the custom nuclei templates. We will bring this feature in the upcoming releases. Nuclei Templates Update reNgine automatically updates the Nuclei templates.","title":"Using reNgine"},{"location":"pentester/usage/#using-rengine","text":"About this document This document will provide the detailed instructions on how to use reNgine.

Scan Engines are capable of performing: reNgine Scan Engine capabilities Subdomain Discovery : Discovers all the subdomains using tools like sublist3r, subfinder, amass, assetfinder, etc. Port Scan : Use to identify the open ports on the subdomains that have been discovered. Currently reNgine uses naabu to check for open ports. We have plans to use masscan in the future. Directory and File Search : Uses dirsearch to discover the directories and files. Fetch all Endpoints : Fetches all the urls for each subdomains from various sources like Open Threat Exchange, Wayback machine, common crawl etc. reNgine uses gau , hakrawler to fetch the endpoints.
