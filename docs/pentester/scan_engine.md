# YAML Configuration for Scan Engine

## Introduction to reNgine YAML Configuration

reNgine provides the ability to customize scan engines via YAMl based configuration. This configuration can be used to select the tools, choose the options provided by the tools etc.

Currently YAML config is supported for

!!! example "YAML Support for"
    * Subdomain Discovery as `subdomain_discovery`
    * Port Scan as `port_scan`
    * Visual Identification as `visual_identification`
    * Directory and File Search as `dir_file_search`
    * Endpoint Gathering as `fetch_url`
    * Vulnerability Scan as `vulnerability_scan`

## Sample YAML Config

``` yaml
subdomain_discovery:
    uses_tool: [ subfinder, sublist3r, assetfinder ]
    thread: 10
    wordlist: default
    amass_config: config_short_name
    subfinder_config: config_short_name

port_scan:
    ports: [ top-100 ]
    exclude_ports: null
    thread: 10

visual_identification:
    port: xlarge
    thread: 2

dir_file_search:
    extensions: [ php,asp,aspx,txt,conf,db,sql,json ]
    recursive: false
    recursive_level: 1
    thread: 100
    wordlist: default

fetch_url:
    uses_tool: [ gau, hakrawler ]
    intensity: aggressive

vulnerability_scan:
    concurrent: 10
    template: all
    severity: all
```

!!! info
    While the above YAML config is **just good enough** to run the scan against the targets, modifying the configurations can give better results.

!!! danger ""
    Before you make any modifications to the YAML Configuration, please note that, wrong configuration may crash the scans. It is adviced that you [learn about YAML](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/) before you make any modifications.

## Detailed guide on configuring Scan Engines

This document will discuss about the available options, possibilities and different configurations required for reNgine.

### subdomain_discovery

`subdomain_discovery` currently supports four different options

!!! example "Available option for subdomain_discovery"
    * uses_tool **(required)**
    * thread (optional)
    * wordlist (optional)
    * amass_config (optional)
    * subfinder_config (optional)

* **uses_tool (required)**

This option allows you to choose the tools required to gather the subdomains. You can use one or more combination of these tools to improve the results.

* Available options for `uses_tool` are:
    * all
    * amass-passive
    * amass-active
    * subfinder
    * sublist3r
    * assetfinder

You can have one or more combination of these tools to improve the results.

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    subdomain_discovery:
      uses_tool: [all]
    ```

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    subdomain_discovery:
      uses_tool: [amass-active, amass-passive, subfinder]
    ```

!!! danger "Unsupported"
    ``` yaml
    subdomain_discovery:
      uses_tool: [amass-active amass-passive subfinder]
    # Unsupported because comma is missing
    ```

!!! danger "Unsupported"
    ``` yaml
    subdomain_discovery:
    uses_tool: [all]
    # Unsupported because uses_tool is a property inside subdomain_discovery and must be indented
    ```

* **thread (optional)**

Number of threads to perform the subdomain discovery. **By default the value for thread is 10.**

* **wordlist (optional)**

Wordlist for `amass-active` which performs brute-force of subdomains using a the wordlists.

* Available Options for `wordlist` are:
    * default
    * short_name_for_wordlist

Please follow the guide on [uploading your own wordlist](/pentester/usage/#wordlist). You need to enter the wordlist short_name here.

!!! info "Default Wordlist"
    If you choose the default wordlist, [Deepmagic top 50,000 prefix wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/deepmagic.com-prefixes-top50000.txt) will be used.

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    subdomain_discovery:
      wordlist: default
    ```

!!! danger "Unsupported"
    ``` yaml
    subdomain_discovery:
      wordlist: [default, short_name]
    ```

!!! danger ""
    reNgine currently does not support multiple wordlists. This feature maybe available in future udpates.

* **amass_config (optional)**

Configuration file for your amass.

Please follow this [guide on how to upload your amass config](/pentester/usage/#adding-new-configurations). Once uploaded, use the short_name with `amass_config` option.

* **subfinder_config (optional)**

Configuration file for your subfinder.

Please follow this [guide on how to upload your subfinder config](/pentester/usage/#adding-new-configurations). Once uploaded, use the short_name with `subfinder_config` option.

### port_scan

Port scan is currently being performed using [naabu](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu), please refer [naabu documentation](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/blob/master/README.md) as well.

`port_scan` currently supports three options

!!! example "Supported option for port_scan"
    * ports **(required)**
    * thread (optional)
    * exclude_ports (optional)

* **ports (required)**

Ports to Scan

* Available options for `ports` are
    * top-100
    * top-1000
    * full (will scan all 65k ports)
    * custom like [80, 443]

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    port_scan:
      ports: [80, 443, 8000, 8080]
    ```

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    port_scan:
      ports: [top-1000, 9000, 1234]
    ```

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    port_scan:
      ports: [full]
    ```

* **thread (optional)**

Number of threads to perform the port scan. **By default the value for thread is 10.**

* **exclude_ports (optional)**

Ports which you would like to exclude from the scan.

!!! check "Supported"
    ``` yaml
    port_scan:
      exclude_ports: [80,443]
    ```
